# Privacy Policy — Chameleon

**Last Updated:** February 23, 2026

## Overview

Chameleon is a browser extension that allows users to inject custom CSS and JavaScript code into web pages. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.

## Data Collection

Chameleon does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All data created and used by the extension is stored locally on your device.

The extension stores the following data locally using Chrome's Storage API:

- Custom CSS and JavaScript code written by the user
- URL match patterns configured by the user
- User profiles, snippets, and extension settings
- Toggle states and preferences

## Data Sharing

Chameleon does **not**:

- Send any data to external servers or third parties
- Use analytics, tracking, or telemetry services
- Collect browsing history, personal information, or usage statistics
- Sell or transfer any user data for any purpose
- Use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes

## Remote Code

The extension executes custom CSS and JavaScript code that is authored entirely by the user. This code is stored locally on the user's device and is never fetched from any remote server.

## Permissions

The extension requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **Scripting**: To inject user-defined CSS and JavaScript into web pages.
- **Active Tab**: To access the currently active tab for applying custom code.
- **Storage**: To save and load user profiles, snippets, and settings locally.
- **Tabs**: To detect tab navigation and apply saved overrides to matching URLs.
- **Web Navigation**: To detect page load events and inject code at the correct time.
- **Host Permissions (All URLs)**: To allow users to apply customizations on any website.
